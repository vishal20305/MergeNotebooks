# Jupyter Notebook Merger
This project provides a Python script to merge multiple Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) from a specified folder into a single notebook. The script maintains the same structure of cells and inserts a markdown cell with the filename before the contents of each notebook, making it clear where each original notebook's content starts. The files are sorted in numerical order before merging.

# Steps:-
1. Place all the .ipynb files you want to merge into a single folder.
2. Open the script NotebooksMerge.ipynb.
3. Modify the folder_path variable to specify the folder containing your notebooks.
4. Modify the output_path variable to specify the desired output file path for the merged notebook.
5. After running the script, the merged notebook will be located at the specified output_path'
